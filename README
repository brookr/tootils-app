This tiny app allows drop-in Twitter monitors. Just setup a Twitter account, and 
a RegExp, and code out what you want to do with the data.

Current Modules:
================

Punctualize!

This numeric tracker can be used to help you keep a running score for 
just how punctual you are.

It works by reading mentions of @punctualize for a number, which 
is assumed to be a report of minutes late to a meeting. Negative
numbers are assumed to be minutes early.


Coming Soon:
============

Twit_Tree!

Just ask @twit_tree how far away another user is from you, and get a reply 
with the connecting chain, up to three degrees, if a link is found.
